                    <p>Conversion, software version 7.0<br>
                    Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub<br>
                    seeds as a pastime activity<br>
                    The toxicity of our city, our city<br>
                    </p>
                    You, what do you own the world?<br>
                    How do you own disorder? Disorder<br>
                    Now somewhere between the sacred silence<br>
                    Sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder<br>
                    <p></p>
                    More wood for their fires, loud neighbors<br>
                    Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck<br>
                    Eating seeds as a pastime activity<br>
                    The toxicity of our city, of our city<br>
                    <p></p>
                    You, what do you own the world?<br>
                    How do you own disorder? Disorder<br>
                    Now somewhere between the sacred silence<br>
                    Sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder<br>
                    <p></p>
                    You, what do you own the world?<br>
                    How do you own disorder?<br>
                    Now somewhere between the sacred silence<br>
                    Sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep<br>
                    Disorder, disorder, disorder<br>

                    When I became the sun<br>
                    I shone life into the man's hearts<br>

                    I shone life into the man's hearts
